  Problems I encountered: The problems I encountered while doing this project were generally Azure-focused problems. While creating the database and server, I had to change the settings in the firewall section. While performing the deployment process, I constantly received a file access error because I entered the name of one of my existing files incorrectly, and it did not get fixed even though I renamed it. I had to create the project in another file and deploy it again. I had a problem pushing to github from vscode and had to solve it from the terminal. Since the Azure syntax is different in SQL codes, I constantly researched while writing code accordingly.
